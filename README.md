# Code Readability Analysis and Prediction

The project involves researching two main questions related to developer readability:

1) Do developers intentionally increase readability?
2) Can we predict whether the readability of a file will be improved?

The procedure of the project involves 
collecting data from repositories and 
extracting information via Pydriller. The data is then saved to a file and 
analyzed using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. 
Two word clouds are created, and a set of keywords is identified to identify commits where the intent of the developer is to increase readability for RQ1.

The algorithms used for this project are Random Forest models to predict readability increase and text preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, stop word removal, and stemming.

Packages used in this project are 
Pydriller 
Jupyterlab, 
Pandas, 
Scipy, 
Matplotlib 
Scikit-learn.
